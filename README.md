Sudoku Camera
=============

Sudoku Camera is an experimental project combining webcam sudoku C++
code from the
[Webcam Sudoku](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/238114/Realtime-Webcam-Sudoku-Solver)
project and android camera Java code from the
[android docs](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/camera.html)
and the [android-ocr](https://github.com/rmtheis/android-ocr)
project. This works after a fashion, but not well enough to be
released as a useable app.

The source files from the
[Webcam Sudoku](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/238114/Realtime-Webcam-Sudoku-Solver)
project, although allegedly open source, do not contain any licence
information. They have been tidied using
[Artistic Style](http://astyle.sourceforge.net), and the over wide
comments tidied using Emacs.
